# Prediction-of-Approval-of-Bank-Loan
In this project the main motive is to Predict whether the person will be Approved for getting the Loan or 
not. The Problem statement was that we had to use Machine Learning algorithm to predict the eligibility 
of a person for Loan. (Scope).Dataset of 13 features which had total 614 data points in it was provided 
which contained customers data like Loan ID, ID, Gender, Married, Education, Self Employed etc. 
which was used to train our model and predict when new data is provided. 
In this Project different libraries like Pandas , Matplotlib , Seaborn are used to work with given data and 
also to plot various graphs and heat maps. We have also used SKLEARN Library for using different ML 
algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) to predict the bank loan status. We have used this 5 models and found out which model
has the best accuracy on predicting the status. Limitations of this project are it would just give an idea 
about the approval, it would not be totally correct because accuracy is not 100%.
